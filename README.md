    <h1>Project: Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Image Classifiers are used in the field of computer vision to identify the content of an image and are applied across various industries.
        As a Machine Learning Engineer at Scones Unlimited, you will be working on an Image Classification model to enhance their scone delivery logistics.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
        Image classifiers are integral to computer vision and have applications in autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, eCommerce, and more.
        Your role at Scones Unlimited is to create an image classification model capable of identifying the type of vehicle delivery drivers use, optimizing routing and order assignments.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Steps Overview</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Data Staging</li>
        <li>Model Training and Deployment</li>
        <li>Lambdas and Step Function Workflow</li>
        <li>Testing and Evaluation</li>
        <li>Optional Challenge</li>
        <li>Cleanup Cloud Resources</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Deploy and Monitor a Machine Learning Workflow for Image Classification</h2>
    <p>
        This section focuses on deploying and monitoring a machine learning workflow for image classification. The key steps include setting up the notebook, data staging, and transforming the data into a usable format.
    </p>

    <h3>Setting up this notebook</h3>
    <p>
        Notes about the instance size and kernel setup: This notebook has been tested on the Python 3 (Data Science) kernel and the ml.t3.medium SageMaker notebook instance.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Staging</h3>
    <p>
        We'll use a sample dataset called CIFAR to simulate the challenges faced by Scones Unlimited in image classification.
        Data staging involves extracting, transforming, and loading the data for use in the project.
    </p>

    <!-- Detailed instructions about data extraction and transformation are omitted -->

    <p>
        With this, you have completed the data staging process, preparing the CIFAR dataset for image classification. This dataset is now ready for training and deployment in Amazon SageMaker.
