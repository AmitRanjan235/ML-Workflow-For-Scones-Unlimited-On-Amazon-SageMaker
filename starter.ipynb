One of the nice things about Step Functions is that [workflows can call other workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-stepfunctions.html), so the team can easily plug your workflow into the broader production architecture for Scones Unlimited.\n","\n","In this next stage you're going to write and deploy three Lambda functions, and then use the Step Functions visual editor to chain them together! Our functions are going to work with a simple data object:\n","\n","```python\n","{\n","    \"inferences\": [], # Output of predictor.predict\n","    \"s3_key\": \"\", # Source data S3 key\n","    \"s3_bucket\": \"\", # Source data S3 bucket\n","    \"image_data\": \"\"  # base64 encoded string containing the image data\n","}\n","```\n","\n","A good test object that you can use for Lambda tests and Step Function executions, throughout the next section, might look like this:\n","\n","```python\n","{\n","  \"image_data\": \"\",\n","  \"s3_bucket\": MY_BUCKET_NAME, # Fill in with your bucket\n","  \"s3_key\": \"test/bicycle_s_000513.png\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","Using these fields, your functions can read and write the necessary data to execute your workflow. Let's start with the first function. Your first Lambda function will copy an object from S3, base64 encode it, and then return it to the step function as `image_data` in an event.\n","\n","Go to the Lambda dashboard and create a new Lambda function with a descriptive name like \"serializeImageData\" and select thr 'Python 3.8' runtime. Add the same permissions as the SageMaker role you created earlier. (Reminder: you do this in the Configuration tab under \"Permissions\"). Once you're ready, use the starter code below to craft your Lambda handler:\n","\n","```python\n","import json\n","import boto3\n","import base64\n","\n","s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n","\n","def lambda_handler(event, context):\n","    \"\"\"A function to serialize target data from S3\"\"\"\n","    \n","    # Get the s3 address from the Step Function event input\n","    key = ## TODO: fill in\n","    bucket = ## TODO: fill in\n","    \n","    # Download the data from s3 to /tmp/image.png\n","    ## TODO: fill in\n","    \n","    # We read the data from a file\n","    with open(\"/tmp/image.png\", \"rb\") as f:\n","        image_data = base64.b64encode(f.read())\n","\n","    # Pass the data back to the Step Function\n","    print(\"Event:\", event.keys())\n","    return {\n","        'statusCode': 200,\n","        'body': {\n","            \"image_data\": image_data,\n","            \"s3_bucket\": bucket,\n","            \"s3_key\": key,\n","            \"inferences\": []\n","        }\n","    }\n","```\n","\n","The next function is responsible for the classification part - we're going to take the image output from the previous function, decode it, and then pass inferences back to the the Step Function.\n","\n","Because this Lambda will have runtime dependencies (i.e. the SageMaker SDK) you'll need to package them in your function. *Key reading:* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package-create.html#python-package-create-with-dependency\n","\n","Create a new Lambda function with the same rights and a descriptive name, then fill in the starter code below for your classifier Lambda.\n","\n","```python\n","import json\n","import sagemaker\n","import base64\n","from sagemaker.serializers import IdentitySerializer\n","\n","# Fill this in with the name of your deployed model\n","ENDPOINT = ## TODO: fill in\n","\n","def lambda_handler(event, context):\n","\n","    # Decode the image data\n","    image = base64.b64decode(## TODO: fill in)\n","\n","    # Instantiate a Predictor\n","    predictor = ## TODO: fill in\n","\n","    # For this model the IdentitySerializer needs to be \"image/png\"\n","    predictor.serializer = IdentitySerializer(\"image/png\")\n","    \n","    # Make a prediction:\n","    inferences = ## TODO: fill in\n","    \n","    # We return the data back to the Step Function    \n","    event[\"inferences\"] = inferences.decode('utf-8')\n","    return {\n","        'statusCode': 200,\n","        'body': json.dumps(event)\n","    }\n","```\n","\n","Finally, we need to filter low-confidence inferences. Define a threshold between 1.00 and 0.000 for your model: what is reasonble for you? If the model predicts at `.70` for it's highest confidence label, do we want to pass that inference along to downstream systems?

We're going to keep it simple and have just one: to invoke Lambda functions. Add three of them chained together.
